## University VLAN Segmentation Project

This project simulates the segmentation of a university network into two departments using Cisco Packet Tracer.

### 🔧 Devices Used
- 1 Cisco Switch
- 4 PCs (2 for Students, 2 for Administration)

### 🔐 VLAN Setup
- VLAN 10: Students – Ports fa0/1, fa0/2
- VLAN 20: Admin – Ports fa0/3, fa0/4

### 🧠 Configuration
- Configured VLANs via CLI
- Assigned IP addresses:
  - Students: 192.168.10.10/24 & 192.168.10.11/24
  - Admin: 192.168.20.10/24 & 192.168.20.11/24
- Verified communication within VLANs
- Prevented cross-VLAN communication (without routing)
